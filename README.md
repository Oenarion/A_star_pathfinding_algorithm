# A* pathfinding algorithm
Repository to test out the A* path finding algorithm with the use of pygames for visualization.

# Constraint
The board can reach 70x70 dimension, because it's both pretty hard to draw more cells then this and both because it could take much more time to perform the algorithm.
Feel free to adjust these limits as you want, you can change them in the main_menu() section, when the inputBoxes get initialized.

# How to use this
Simply download the repo, run the file, add the starting point / goal point that you want, and then either press SPACEBAR to see the final result, or press Q to see the path that the algorithm chooses step by step.
